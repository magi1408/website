<h1 style="color:beige;">About me and my work:</h1>
<p style="color:back;"> <span> My name is Magdalena Petrowa and I own a nail salon for over 5 years. I have 4 certificates each of them is for different thing. <br>
I have a certificate for two types of decorations: "Work with spider gel" and "Built-in decorations".<br>
Now I am learning new types of decorations and construction techniques which later I will include in my own courses.<br>
I have participated in many competitions with many prestigious awards. My salon is in Gabrovo, Bulgaria and it's <br>
one of the most famous salons in the area. We offer various procedures such as: manicure, pedicure, <br>
hand skin therapy and medical pedicure.As well as consultations on how to take better care of your skin. <br>
On the contact page you will find the address of my salon, my Facebook and Instagram pages and my phone number. <br>
You can book your appointment at any one of these places, also here on the site.<span> </p>
